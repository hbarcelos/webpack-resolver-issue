# Webpack Resolver Issue

`eslint-plugin-import` webpack resolver issue detils. Please refer to the project [issue](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/issues/1511) for more details.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

2. Run ESLint

    ```sh
    yarn eslint src
    ```

## My findings so far

- If I'm using the default `webpack` config location at `<root>/webpack.config.js`, I can have the following on my `.eslintrc.json`

    ```json
    "settings": {
        "import/resolver": "webpack"
    }
    ```

    In this case, **it works just fine**.

- The issue only occurs when `webpack` config is not at its default location. I've copied `webpack.config.js` to `webpack.dev.config.js`. Then I had to add the following content to my `.eslintrc.json`:
            
    ```json
    "settings": {
        "import/resolver": {
            "webpack": {
                "config": "webpack.dev.config.js"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    When runnign `eslint`, I get the following error:

    ```
